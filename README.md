# Qudit

## Progress

#### Week01

- 1. Reviewed the article: _Efficient Fault-Tolerant Quantum Protocol for Differential Privacy in the Shuffle Model_ [1].
- 2. Learned how to work with Google Cirq and implemented a couple of basic test programs.
- 3. Created a GitHub repository to store the library code.
- 4. Wrote implementations of X and Z Gates.
- 5. Conducted simulations and testing of the created Gates.

#### Week02

- 1. The project was consolidated and organized.
- 2. A circuit builder function was created that handles input in two formats.
- 3. A function that formats the output was implemented.
- 4. I created the initial implementation of the Hadamard gate according to the article [1].
- 5. I also found and watched the tutorial about _How to Generalize Qubit Circuits to Qudits_ [2].

#### Week03

- 1. The project was consolidated and organized.
- 2. I read articles about the implementation of the CNOT gate [3].
- 3. The implementation of CNOT gate was started.
- 4. I found errors in the exsisting code.
- 5. These errors were fixed.

#### Week04

- 1. CNOT gate was implemented.
